    Location-Based Crime Prediction estimates regional crime vulnerability
    using probabilistic risk modeling. It identifies high-risk zones and
    categorizes cities into risk levels for strategic deployment planning.

      <h3>Risk Score by Area</h3>
      <p>
        This chart presents the predicted crime risk score for each city based
        on machine learning probability outputs. The risk score is calculated on
        a percentage scale, indicating the likelihood of high-risk classification.
        Higher scores suggest elevated crime vulnerability in specific regions.
        This visualization enables comparative analysis across multiple cities.
        It supports strategic patrol allocation and helps law enforcement
        prioritize areas requiring intensified monitoring and preventive measures.

      <h3>Top 5 High-Risk Zones</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization identifies the five cities with the highest predicted
        crime risk probabilities. Ranking high-risk zones enables targeted
        intervention strategies and focused resource deployment. It provides a
        concise overview of critical urban areas that require immediate
        attention. Monitoring these zones over time helps evaluate policy
        effectiveness and crime prevention efforts. This insight strengthens
        proactive policing by prioritizing areas with the greatest predicted
        vulnerability.

      <h3>Risk Distribution — Crime Vulnerability Segmentation</h3>
      <p>
        The risk distribution chart categorizes cities into high, medium, and
        low-risk groups based on probability thresholds. This segmentation
        provides a broader perspective on national crime vulnerability patterns.
        A higher concentration of high-risk zones may indicate systemic
        structural issues requiring policy intervention. Balanced distribution
        suggests stable regional crime dynamics. This classification framework
        supports strategic planning and enhances decision-making by translating
        model predictions into actionable categories.
