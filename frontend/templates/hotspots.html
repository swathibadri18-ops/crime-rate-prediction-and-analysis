    <h1>Crime Hotspots Analysis</h1>

    <!-- MODULE DESCRIPTION -->
    <p class="module-desc">
      Crime Hotspot Analysis identifies geographic areas with a high concentration of criminal activity using historical crime data. It helps law enforcement and analysts visually detect patterns, trends, and recurring high-risk zones. By combining spatial mapping with time-based analysis, hotspots reveal when and where crimes are most likely to occur.
This enables smarter patrol planning, faster response times, and optimized resource allocation. Hotspot analysis also supports proactive policing by highlighting emerging risk areas before crime escalates.
Overall, it transforms raw crime records into actionable insights for safer and more informed decision-making.

      <!-- 1.1 GEOGRAPHIC -->
      <div

      >
        <h3>1.1 Geographic Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Analyze how crimes are distributed across cities and regions
          to identify persistent spatial hotspots and high-risk zones.
	</p>
	<p>
	Geographic Distribution shows how crime incidents are spread across different regions and locations.
	It highlights high-crime and low-crime areas through maps and spatial visuals.
	This analysis helps identify regional patterns and concentration zones.
	It supports targeted policing and location-based crime prevention strategies.

      <!-- 1.2 TEMPORAL -->
      <div
        class="card clickable"
        onclick="location.href='/hotspots/temporal'"
      >
        <h3>1.2 Temporal Trends</h3>
        <p>
          Examine how crime patterns evolve over time to detect
          seasonal variations, peak periods, and long-term trends.
	</p>
	<p>
	Temporal Trend analyzes how crime rates change over time across days, months, or years.
	It helps identify seasonal patterns, peaks, and declining periods in criminal activity.
	This insight supports forecasting and proactive crime prevention planning.
	Temporal trends enable data-driven decisions by linking time patterns with crime behavior.
