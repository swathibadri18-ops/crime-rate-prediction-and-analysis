  <h1>Geographic Distribution of Crime</h1>

  <p class="module-desc">
    Geographic analysis visualizes how crime incidents are spread across cities.
    It helps identify persistent urban hotspots, reveals spatial crime patterns,
    and supports location-specific intervention strategies. This analysis
    directly influences patrol planning and hotspot policing.

      <h3>Crime Count by City</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization compares crime volumes across major cities.
        Cities with consistently higher crime counts are identified as
        persistent hotspots. Such regions require focused surveillance
        and targeted law enforcement strategies. The comparison helps
        prioritize resource allocation. It also supports urban safety planning.

      <h3>Crime Domain Distribution by City</h3>
      <p>
        This chart highlights how different crime types dominate
        specific cities. Understanding city-specific crime profiles
        allows tailored intervention strategies. It supports
        crime-type focused policing. This insight improves
        predictive feature engineering. It strengthens crime prevention planning.

      <h3>Hotspot Concentration Insight</h3>
      <p>
        Cities showing high crime density across multiple categories
        represent long-term hotspots. These locations are critical
        for predictive policing. Continuous monitoring enables
        proactive intervention. Such insights reduce crime escalation.
        They form the basis for risk forecasting models.
