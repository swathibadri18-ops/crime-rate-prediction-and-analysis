    Recurrence Prediction estimates the probability of repeat crime
    occurrences based on temporal gaps between incidents. It models
    survival probability and recurrence likelihood across time intervals.
    This helps anticipate repeat offenses and supports proactive
    intervention planning.

      <h3>Survival Curve — Time Until Next Crime</h3>
      <p>
        The survival curve represents the probability that no new crime
        occurs within a specific number of days. A declining curve indicates
        increasing likelihood of recurrence. This model helps estimate
        stability periods between crime incidents.

      <h3>Probability of Repeat Crime</h3>
      <p>
        This curve estimates the probability of repeat crime occurrence
        over time. Increasing probability reflects rising recurrence risk.
        It supports targeted monitoring during high-risk periods.

      <p>
        This visualization ranks cities by recurrence intensity.
        Higher values indicate frequent repeat offenses. It supports
        geographic prioritization for preventive enforcement.
