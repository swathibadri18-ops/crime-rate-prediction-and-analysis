  <h1>Temporal Crime Trends</h1>

  <p class="module-desc">
    Temporal Trends Analysis examines how crime patterns change over time.
    By analyzing yearly, monthly, and weekly distributions, this module
    identifies high-risk periods and recurring temporal patterns.
    These insights help anticipate future incidents and support
    proactive policing strategies. Temporal features also play
    a critical role in crime prediction models.

      <h3>Year-wise Crime Trend</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization illustrates how the total number of crime
        incidents has evolved over the years. Long-term upward or
        downward trends help evaluate the effectiveness of policing
        policies and interventions. Sudden increases may indicate
        emerging threats or socio-economic changes. Declining trends
        often reflect successful crime prevention strategies.

      <h3>Monthly Crime Distribution</h3>
      <p>
        This chart highlights seasonal variations in crime occurrence.
        Certain months often experience higher crime rates due to
        social events, holidays, or environmental factors.
        Understanding monthly patterns enables law enforcement
        agencies to prepare for seasonal crime spikes. These insights
        significantly improve short-term crime forecasting accuracy.

      <h3>Crime by Day of Week</h3>
      <p>
        Crime frequency varies significantly across different days
        of the week. This analysis identifies high-risk days such as
        weekends or specific weekdays. Such insights support optimized
        police deployment and patrol scheduling. Day-level trends also
        reflect behavioral and social activity patterns relevant for
        predictive modeling.
